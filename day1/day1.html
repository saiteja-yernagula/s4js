features of javascript
1) dynamically typed language - no need to specify a dataype
   while defining a variable
2) single threaded- it can perform one operation at a time
3) intrepreted compiled- jit compilation - just in time
4) highlevel - we can write code in human readable format
5) synchronous and asynchronous
6) cross platform support

html css - browser
javascript - js engine---browser
 chrome - v8 engine
 edge - chakra
 firefox- spidermonkey

 how js code works
 1) parser ---   where it will check the syntax
    ast - abstract syntax tree-- where the code will converted
    into set of tokens
  2)intrepreted compiled - highlevel - lowlevel-
  3) execution--output


  line 1          synchronous
  line 2 10secs  asynchronous
  line 3          synchronous
  line upto 1000lines  synchronous

  line1
  line3
  line upto 1000
  line 2

  event loop mechanism

  callstack- which is responsible for executing functions
  webapi- which provides some apis like timers, callbacks
        promises
callback que- where the asynchronous programs will wait
event loop - it will check the callstack and callback que-
  continously for smoother execution

  synchronous- which executes immediately and high priority
  asynchronous - parallel level of execution
