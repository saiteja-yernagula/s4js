javascript history
javascript was introduced in 1995 by brendan eich in 10days

1997- es1 -ecma script
1998 -es2
1999- es3
2009- es5
2015 -es6- pre requistic for react

uses of javascript
frontend - js,react
backend- node js
app development - react native
game development
iot development 

features of javascript
1) dynamically typed language - no need to specify a dataype
   while defining a variable
2) single threaded- it can perform one operation at a time
3) intrepreted compiled- jit compilation - just in time
4) highlevel - we can write code in human readable format
5) synchronous and asynchronous
6) cross platform support

html css - browser
javascript - js engine---browser
 chrome - v8 engine
 edge - chakra
 firefox- spidermonkey

 how js code works
 1) parser ---   where it will check the syntax
    ast - abstract syntax tree-- where the code will converted
    into set of tokens
  2)intrepreted compiled - highlevel - lowlevel-
  3) execution--output


  line 1          synchronous
  line 2 10secs  asynchronous
  line 3          synchronous
  line upto 1000lines  synchronous

  line1
  line3
  line upto 1000
  line 2

  event loop mechanism

  callstack- which is responsible for executing functions
  webapi- which provides some apis like timers, callbacks
        promises
callback que- where the asynchronous programs will wait
event loop - it will check the callstack and callback que-
  continously for smoother execution

  synchronous- which executes immediately and high priority
  asynchronous - parallel level of execution

day 1 task
  write a javascript alert in internal , external, inline 
  alert('hell0 world')
  Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different
   types of variables (var, let, and const) and
    prints their values to the console.
  
  Create variables of different data types: number, string, boolean, 
  undefined, null, object, array, and function
  
  Use the typeof operator to log the type of each variable
   to the console
     

   



   day 3 tasks
   
  Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables using 
  different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.
  
  
  Expand the script to include a ternary operation 
  that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.
  
  Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and 
  set it to a value between 0 and 100.
   Use nested ternary operators to classify the score into grades:
    A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45), and F (below 45).
     Log the grade.
  
   Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
   use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30),
    "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19), and "Cold" (below 10). 
    Log the result.
  
   Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
   use the ternary operator to classify the age into "Child"
    (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), 
    and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result
