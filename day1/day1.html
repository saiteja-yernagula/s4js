   how js name came
java javascript
mocha ---livescript
microsoft -jscript
sun microsystems - java---javascript

javascript
it is a high level programming language that is used to
create interactive and dynamic nature to the webpage

ex
add to cart
filter 
search
sorting
validation
api calls
interactive things


javascript history
javascript was introduced in 1995 by brendan eich in 10days

1997- es1 -ecma script
1998 -es2
1999- es3
2009- es5
2015 -es6- pre requistic for react

uses of javascript
frontend - js,react
backend- node js
app development - react native
game development
iot development 

features of javascript
1) dynamically typed language - no need to specify a dataype
   while defining a variable
2) single threaded- it can perform one operation at a time
3) intrepreted compiled- jit compilation - just in time
4) highlevel - we can write code in human readable format
5) synchronous and asynchronous
6) cross platform support

html css - browser
javascript - js engine---browser
 chrome - v8 engine
 edge - chakra
 firefox- spidermonkey

 how js code works
 1) parser ---   where it will check the syntax
    ast - abstract syntax tree-- where the code will converted
    into set of tokens
  2)intrepreted compiled - highlevel - lowlevel-
  3) execution--output


  line 1          synchronous
  line 2 10secs  asynchronous
  line 3          synchronous
  line upto 1000lines  synchronous

  line1
  line3
  line upto 1000
  line 2

  event loop mechanism

  callstack- which is responsible for executing functions
  webapi- which provides some apis like timers, callbacks
        promises
callback que- where the asynchronous programs will wait
event loop - it will check the callstack and callback que-
  continously for smoother execution

  synchronous- which executes immediately and high priority
  asynchronous - parallel level of execution

day 1 task
  write a javascript alert in internal , external, inline 
  alert('hell0 world')
  Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different
   types of variables (var, let, and const) and
    prints their values to the console.
  
  Create variables of different data types: number, string, boolean, 
  undefined, null, object, array, and function
  
  Use the typeof operator to log the type of each variable
   to the console
     

   



   day 3 tasks
   
  Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables using 
  different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.
  
  
  Expand the script to include a ternary operation 
  that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.
  
  Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and 
  set it to a value between 0 and 100.
   Use nested ternary operators to classify the score into grades:
    A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45), and F (below 45).
     Log the grade.
  
   Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
   use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30),
    "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19), and "Cold" (below 10). 
    Log the result.
  
   Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
   use the ternary operator to classify the age into "Child"
    (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), 
    and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result

  Task 1: Day of the Week Message
Scenario: Develop a webpage that displays a special message 
based on the current day of the week.

“Start your week strong!” for Monday.
“Keep going!” for Tuesday.
“Halfway there!” for Wednesday.
“Almost the weekend!” for Thursday.
“Happy Friday!” for Friday.
“Enjoy your weekend!” for Saturday and Sunday.

Task:
Get the current day of the week.
Display the corresponding message.



Task 2: Traffic Light Simulation
Scenario: Simulate a traffic light system.

“Stop” if the light is red.
“Get Ready” if the light is yellow.
“Go” if the light is green.
Task:

Prompt the user to enter the color of the traffic light.
Display the corresponding action.



Task 3: Discount Calculator
Scenario: Calculate the discount based on the total purchase amount.

“No discount” if the amount is less than $50.
“5% discount” if the amount is between $50 and $100.
“10% discount” if the amount is between $101 and $200.
“15% discount” if the amount is above $200.
Task:

Prompt the user to enter the total purchase amount.
Display the discount percentage.


Task 4: Restaurant Menu
Scenario: You are developing a restaurant menu system that provides
 the price of a dish based on the dish name.

Task:
Assume a variable dish holds the name of the dish as a string (e.g.,  "Biriyani", "shawarma", "Fried rice", "veg pula").
Print the price.

Task 5: Simple Calculator
Scenario: You are developing a simple calculator that performs
 basic arithmetic operations.

Task:

Assume variables num1 and num2 hold two numbers, and operator 
holds the arithmetic operator as a string (e.g., “+”).
Use a switch case statement to perform the operation
 and store the result in a variable result.
Print the result.

  
  

loops task
