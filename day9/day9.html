        scopes
        it is a life or a accessibility of an variable

        global scopes
        variables that are declared at global level have a
        global means we can access anywhere in the program

        var a=10
        let b=20
        const c=30
        console.log(a,b,c)

        function fun(){
        console.log(a,b,c)
        }
        fun()

        block scope
        variables that are defined within a block {} can 
        able to access within the block only and outside 
        it throws the error
        let and const have block scope
        {

       }
       console.log(a)//10-var doesn't have a block scope
       console.log(c)//error-have a block scope

       local scope - function scope
       variables that are defined within a function can only
       be accessed within the function only and outside it throws
       error
        var ,let and const have local scope
