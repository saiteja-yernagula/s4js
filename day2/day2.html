    javascript
    features
    uses
    how js code works
    how event loop works

    how to insert javascript
    1) inline-- embed the logic within the element
    using onclick event 
    <button onclick="console.log('hello from inline')">click</button>

    2) internal
    <script >js logic</script> define script tag at 
    the bottom of the body 
    how to run--open with live server -ctrl shift j

    3) external
    embed the logic within external document 

    crate a file with .js extension
    link using script src
    <script src="demo.js"></script>

    variables 
    variable are the containers for storing data and 
    the data could be anything

    variables are defined  with var or let or const keywords followed
    by variable name (identifier) and value will be assigned
    using = operator

    var a=10;
    let b=20;
    const c=30;
    d=40;//automatic variable

    identifier rules
    1) variables names are case sensitive
      let a=10
      let A=20
    2) variables can contain letters, numbers , dollar and undersccore
      but it should start with letter , $ and _
      let a=10
      let $b=20
      let _c=30
    3) reserved words cannot be used as variable names
    4) use camelCase -- userName ,userEmail

    variable conventions
    1) declaration- it is process of defining a variable name 
    in an environment
     var a;

    2) undefined
     a variable without an value
      var a;
      console.log(a)

    3) not defined -error
    an unexisiting variable
    console.log(b)

    4) assignment- it is a process of assigning a value 
    in the next line after declartion
    let a;
    a=10;

    reassignment
    a=10
    a=20

    5) intialization - it is process of defining a variable
    and assigning a value within the line
    let a=10;

    6) hoisting
    it is a behavior where the declaration of an variable
    and functions are moved to top even before the execution
    
    console.log(a)//undefined due to hoisting
    var a;
     a=10;

     datatypes 
     primitive datatypes
     1) which stores single values
     2) which are immutable
     3) which stores in stack
     4) which are pass by value and get by value

     non primitive datatypes
     1) which store multiple values
     2) which are mutable
     3) which stores in heap
     4) which are get by reference and pass by reference

     primitive
1) strings
     it is a collection of characters that are enclosed in
     'single' or "double"  or `backticks` quotes
     let str='hello world'
     let tech='javascript'
     console.log(str)//hello world
     console.log(tech)//javascript

     console.log(str[0])//h
     str[0]='z'
     console.log(str)//hello world- because of immutability

 2) number- everything is a number even if it is negative
 or positive or floating values
 let a=10
 let b=-10
 let c=10.9
 console.log(typeof c)//number

 3) boolean - it always return true or falses
 console.log(2==2)//true
 console.log(2==3)//false

 4) undefined
 5) null - it is an intentional absence of an value
 let userid;
 console.log(userid+10)//nan

 let userid=null;
 console.log(userid+10)//10
 
 non primitive
 1) array- it is used to store collection of items in a single
   variable and can be accessed by numbered indexing
   let arr=[1,2,3]
   console.log(arr)//[1,2,3]
   console.log(arr[0])//1
   arr[0]='html'
   console.log(arr)//['html',2,3]//are mutable

 2) objects
 it is used to store the collection of data in key value pairs
 and accessed by named indexing
 let obj={
 name:'john',
 age:24
 }
 console.log(obj)//{entire obj}
 console.log(obj.name)//dot notation-john
 console.log(obj['age'])//square notation-24
   
 3) function - it is a block of reusable code that is used
 to perform one task
 function greet(){
 console.log('hello')
 }
 greet()


   date
   new map
   new set
   symbol
   bigint 
     -->
  

    <script>
     function greet(){
 console.log('hello')
 }
 greet()
 greet()
 greet()
    </script>
